Previously, over time, there was a cherry tree in one of the gardens over time. When spring came, first white flowers bloomed on the tree. Then the red cherries began to shake.
The children ate the fruits of the cherry tree.
After a while, moles settled in the basement of this beautiful tree. Worms sat around their roots.
Ants started to wander around the trunk of the tree. Bees and birds have nested on the upstairs branches.
He was bored with these guests who filled his cherry tree house one day. He said to them:
- My dear guests! - Tell me how long will you be staying at home?
- This is our home, viz viz výz, said the bee. We will now always sit with you.
- No, said the cherry tree. You buzz and bother me. Then the moles dig up my soil.
The squirrels roam on me. This is my house. The worm and mole started talking immediately.
- Dear cherry tree, thank you for staying in your home. But we also help you. We shed the soil you roots day and night.
So you can easily root deeper. You're improving.
The bees upstairs said:
- Who is picking up the honey of your flowers? No honey would be taken from the flowers without us.
The birds said:
- Our merry voices would be bored alone if we didn't have conversations, they said.
Of course you have us good. But we have a benefit for you too, said the mole. Look around. Do you see anything that doesn't work at all?
Cherry tree thought. He deserved his friends.
He learned that his guests were also useful for him. He thanked them.
They never left the tree alone. They protected it from pests, kept their soil clean.
