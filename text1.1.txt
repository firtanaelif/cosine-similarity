Once upon a time. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful village in a lush forest in shallow straw. The birds are chirping. People are hardworking. Everybody called it “Green Village”.
Two girls, September and April, lived in this beautiful village. Eylül was very kind, sweet-spoken, smiling. Nisan was jealous and kind-hearted. One day, September's mother told him:
- Girl, go to the fountain and bring water. Let's cook, he said.
At that time, there was no faucet in the houses. People would meet their water needs from the fountains near them.
September took the jug. He's on his way. When he arrived at the fountain, he met an old woman. The old woman asked for a glass of water from September.
- My beautiful daughter. “Give me a glass of water to that old mom,” she said.
- Of course my aunt said, September.
There was a glass at the beginning of the fountain so that those who came would relax. Eylül filled the water immediately. Grandma was very happy. He prayed to him.
- How kind of a good girl you are. From now on, he said, "Speak out of his mouth, violets, roses, gold, diamonds." Then he suddenly disappeared.
He filled the September jug ??and came home. He explained what happened. As he was telling, flowers, gold and diamonds were pouring out of his mouth.
Since Eylul was so generous, she was distributing gold, diamonds to the poor in the village. He was very jealous when he saw this state of April and September.
He took a test in his hand and went to the fountain. There he started to wait for the old woman.
Granny came to the fountain a little later. This time he asked for a glass of water from April.
- Take your own water. "I won't give you a sip of water," he said.
- I am old. Moreover, I am sick. What if you give a glass of water, she said. Giving water is good.
- I can't, April said. My dress gets wet. Leave it, tell me how the pearls and pearls pour out of my mouth.
- If you're so bad-hearted, after that, smell of bad smell from your mouth, said the grandma.
Then he disappeared. This old woman turned out to be a fairy. Nisan is very surprised. He immediately returned to his village. When he opened his mouth, bad smells started to spread.
This continued until he understood his mistake. All these things went to the Sultan's ear. Summoning September to the palace, the Sultan married his son to him.
He set an example for everyone with his sweet tongue. Kind hearted Eylül and his family lived happily for many years.
